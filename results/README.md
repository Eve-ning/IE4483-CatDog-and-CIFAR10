# Results

These are the results obtained by us through our experiments.

## Syntax

`<MODEL_NAME>_<AUGMENTED?>_<FILETYPE>`

Both `train` and `val` are images we took from **TensorBoard**.

`predictions` is the prediction plot generated of a subset of our 
validation data.

## Notes

We don't have `aug` for CIFAR10 as it takes way too long.
